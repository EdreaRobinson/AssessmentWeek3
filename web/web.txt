-- How the Web Works --

When a URL is entered, a request goes to a Domain Name Server(DNS), which directs you to the appropriate website server by using
the IP address. The browser sends a request to that server for the page you requested using Hypertext Transfer Protocol(HTTP). When
the server receives the request, it looks for and returns the requested document to the browser.

When a link is clicked on, the browser is prompted to access the "hidden" information (URL) associated with the item you clicked on.
This is when the DNS lookup occurs. Once the IP address is located, the website is returned to the browser and the user can begin
making requests.  The requests are made for the files that allow the page to be displayed by the browser, which could include images,
JavaSript, HTML and CSS files, or other types of files.
